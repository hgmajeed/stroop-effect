# Stroop Task Analysis
This was the second introductory project in statistics required by Udacity.  In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to calculate **one-tailed, depended t-test** to see if the time required to complete the **incongruent task** is significantly larger than the time required to complete the **congruent task**. <br>

The dataset was provided by Udacity. All analysis in Microsoft Excel  were copied and pasted into word document. The final product is a PDF file that I uploaded to `strop-task-analysis` repository.

# What is Stroop Experiment, congruent task, and incongruent task?
In a Stroop experiment, a participant is required to accomplish two tasks. In the first task, **congruent**, the participant is presented with a list of names of colors written in ink’s color that matches the word’s meaning. In the second task, **incongruent**, the participant is presented with another list of names of colors but written in ink’s color that does not match the word’s meaning. In each task, the time is recorded.
